    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>A manufactured home  is built in a factory, according to the Manufactured Home Construction and  Safety Standards of June 1976 (&ldquo;the HUD Code&rdquo;-- <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2010-title24-vol5/CFR-2010-title24-vol5-part3280" rel="external">24 C.F.R. Part 3280</a>), and secured on a permanent, nonremovable steel frame or chassis. The home can be built as one complete section, or in multiple sections, that are transported, assembled and installed at the home site.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How is manufactured housing different from a mobile or modular home?</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Mobile homes, or trailers, are built on wheels and can be  pulled by a vehicle. Built prior to the 1976 HUD Code, these structures are  defined as &ldquo;mobile homes&rsquo;, and mortgages secured by mobile homes are not  eligible for sale to Freddie Mac.</p>
      <p>Manufactured homes must be built in compliance with the the HUD Code  The towing hitch, wheels, and axles must be removed and the dwelling must  assume the characteristics of site-built housing. Like manufactured homes, modular homes (or other factory built dwellings)  are not built to compliance with the HUD  code. They&rsquo;re built to conform to  state,  local or regional building codes and are usually legally classified as real  property. Typically, modular or other  factory built homes (not HUD Code homes) are  eligible   as site-built single-family home or financing, appraisal and  construction financing purposes.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is a "site-built" home? </a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Traditional "site-built" homes are constructed entirely at the building site, not a factory. Common construction materials are 2x4s and 4x6s precut wood used for framing and trusses. Site-built homes must conform to state, local or regional codes where the house is located and they comprise the majority of all new homes constructed today.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How do I know a home meets the HUD Code?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>When newly built, every manufactured home is inspected at the factory by an independent third-party inspector certified by HUD. The manufactured home will have:</p>
      <p>A special HUD Certification Label affixed to the exterior of the home indicating it has been designed, constructed and inspected to comply with the HUD Code standards</p>
      <p>A HUD Data Plate/Compliance Certificate, which is a paper label mounted in the home, that contains, among other things, the manufacturer's name, trade/model name, year manufactured and serial number, and a list of the certification label number(s), etc. The data plate is typically affixed in a readily accessible and visible location (e.g., near the main electrical panel, in a kitchen cabinet, or a bedroom closet).</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is the difference between a manufactured home titled as real property and a manufactured home titled as personal property?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      <p>Manufactured homes may be legally  classified as real property or personal property based on how they are titled  in accordance with state law. In general, manufactured homes can only be  classified as real property if they are permanently affixed to the land. A loan  secured by a manufactured home titled as real property will be secured by the  manufactured home itself and the real property (land) the manufactured home is  located on. Freddie Mac purchases mortgages secured by manufactured homes  titled as real property.</p>
      <p>Manufactured homes classified as  personal property are generally treated more like a vehicle under state law.  Many times, the owner owns the manufactured home and rents or leases the real  property on which the manufactured home is located. A loan secured by a  manufactured home that is titled as personal property will generally be secured  by the manufactured home, but not the land the manufactured home is located on.  Freddie Mac does not currently purchase mortgages secured by manufactured homes  titled as personal property. However, we&rsquo;re exploring opportunities to purchase  this type of financing.</p>
