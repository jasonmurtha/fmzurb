      <p class="lead">Kamara remembers the exact moment when she fully realized the difference her work makes in people's lives. It was at the grand opening of an apartment property for low-income seniors in Chicago.</p>

      <p>"There was a woman moving in with all of her belongings in grocery bags," she says. "No matter how hard her journey had been up until that moment, there was a good chance the rest of her life would be spent in safety and comfort."</p>
      <p>Working in the Targeted Affordable Housing area in Freddie Mac's Multifamily business, Kamara's main focus today: Putting together financing options that will help keep apartments affordable to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and families, seniors, veterans, the homeless, and people with mental and physical disabilities.</p>
      <p>Kamara travels coast to coast to craft these solutions. They require a lot of coordination &ndash; among lenders, community organizations, government entities, and groups within Freddie Mac. "It's a highly collaborative exercise," she says.</p>
      <p>The conversations involved often spark new product ideas or ways to close funding gaps. "When I see people in need, it pulls on my heart strings," says Kamara. "So I ask people I know, 'Hey, have we tried this before? Is it even possible?' And the excitement starts to build at the prospect of innovation taking place."</p>
      <p>"When all of the hard work is done and I see the results, it gives me a strong sense of purpose," Kamara says of all of her housing efforts. "It makes me want to do more."</p>
