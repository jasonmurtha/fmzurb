      <p>On September 6, 2008, the Director of FHFA appointed FHFA as our Conservator. Upon its appointment as Conservator, FHFA immediately succeeded to, among other things, the right of holders of our common stock to vote with respect to the election of directors. As a result, stockholders no longer have the ability to recommend director nominees or vote for the election of our directors. Instead, on an annual basis beginning in 2009, the Conservator has elected directors by a written consent in lieu of an annual meeting. Accordingly, we do not expect to hold stockholders' meetings during the conservatorship, nor will we prepare or provide proxy statements for the solicitation of proxies.</p>
