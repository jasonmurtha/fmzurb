                                <p class="weight-normal flex-up gutter-bottom">Shared equity homeownership is an umbrella term for programs that provide homeownership opportunities with lasting affordability, sometimes referred to as “permanently affordable homeownership programs" or homeownership programs with “lasting affordability" or “long-term affordability." These programs generally make a one-time investment to create homeownership opportunities that are affordable for purchase by a low- or moderate-income homebuyer. In return for owning a home at an affordable cost, the homeowners agree to certain restrictions including limitations on returns upon resale or limitations on conveyances of the property. In effect, homeowners “share" some of the proceeds from resale to pay the opportunity forward to the next homebuyer with low or moderate income.</p>
								<p class="weight-normal flex-up gutter-bottom">The majority of shared equity homeownership programs (“SEH Programs") are resale-restricted programs, meaning that they restrict the maximum price for which the home may be resold and restrict who may purchase the property to income-eligible households. Hence, buyers with low or moderate income purchase and resell homes at prices below fair market value in order to keep the home affordable.</p>

Upgrading to energy-efficient features can reduce energy costs and help to preserve affordability of homeownership, especially in underserved markets where homes are older and in need of these upgrades. But, financing these improvements is also a challenge for homeowners in these markets. Under Duty to Serve, we're developing new mortgage products and enhancing current ones to make financing these energy renovations easier.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p>Preservation of affordable homeownership entails ensuring that the price of a home is affordable to the initial buyer and subsequent buyers over a long-term period, whether purchasing a newly constructed home or an existing home. Additionally, preserving affordable housing can also be achieved by reducing housing costs through utility savings, and through energy efficiency home improvements.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What are shared-equity homeownership programs under Freddie Mac’s 
Single-Family Duty to Serve?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p>Under Duty to Serve, shared equity homeownership programs provide  homeownership opportunities with lasting or long-term affordability. These programs  generally make a one-time investment to create affordable homeownership for homebuyers  with low or moderate income. In return, the homeowners agree to certain  restrictions, including limitations on returns upon resale or limitations on  conveyances of the property. In effect, homeowners &ldquo;share&rdquo; some of the proceeds  from resale to pay the opportunity forward to the next homebuyer with low or  moderate income.</p>
	<p>Most of these programs are resale-restricted  programs, which means that they restrict the home&rsquo;s maximum selling price and who  may purchase the property to income-eligible households. Hence, buyers with low  or moderate income purchase and resell homes at prices below fair market value,  to keep the home affordable.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What’s a community land trust?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p>A community land trust  (CLT) is a type of permanently affordable homeownership program. Under the  Community Land Trust model, the Community Land Trust owns land and leases it  under a long-term ground lease to low- and moderate-income homebuyers who  finance the purchase of the structure on the land through a first lien  mortgage. The ground lease contains certain land use restrictions and other  restrictions such as occupancy, resale price and financing that ensure the  continued use of the property for low-   and moderate-income households.</p>
<p>Community land trusts  (CLTs) are typically community-based nonprofits, state or local governments. They  typically acquire properties by purchasing them at market rate or at a discount,  through in-kind donations, or via state/local agencies. The borrower must sign  a ground lease. </p>

    <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What’s a community land trust ground lease?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p>The vast majority of CLTs utilize renewable, 99-year ground leases to create shared equity homeownership opportunities. The homeowner leases the land from the CLT for a nominal monthly ground lease fee while s/he owns and obtains mortgage financing for the improvements. Sometimes, the CLT provides additional subsidy beyond the fair market value of the land in order to make the home affordable for a household with low or moderate income.</p>

    <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is an income-based resale restricted program?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p> Income-based resale restricted programs, also known as  deed restriction programs, are a type of permanently affordable homeownership program that  create and preserve affordable housing for borrowers with low and moderate  income. These programs restrict  the sales price of properties for initial and subsequent borrowers. The  restrictions are imposed by nonprofits, state and local governments or  municipalities, and are recorded prescribed and enforced through a legal  document called a deed covenant.</p>
	<p>Deed covenants sometimes only have 30-year terms due to state rules  against perpetuities. In these instances, affordability of the homes is  preserved by ensuring the shared equity program has the preemptive option to  purchase the home and may transfer this option to an eligible buyer. Income-based  resale restricted programs have every new homeowner sign a new deed covenant  with a new term. That way, the affordable home is preserved and serves  subsequent homebuyers with low or moderate income.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">I’m a lender, why should I participate in shared equity programs?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p>In  addition to strengthening your commitment to help more families with very low-, low- and moderate-income attain and sustain homeownership, here are other  reasons to consider shared equity programs: </p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>May help you  meet your Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) mandates – </strong>based on  your CRA strategy.</li>
	<li><strong>Increase  your affordable footprint – </strong>provides entry into a niche market  and help you strengthen your affordability goals</li>
	<li><strong>Expand  business opportunities –</strong> These programs are not markets that are served. If  borrowers are trying to capture a new market within affordable space, this  could be something that they want to consider.</li>

Freddie Mac believes that shared  equity providers are entities that may help mitigate losses if a borrower is in  default.  <a href="https://myhomekeeper.org/view-the-public-homekeeper-national-data-hub-dashboard/" rel="extneral">Studies show</a> that shared  equity homeowners were 10 times less likely to be in foreclosure than  homeowners in the conventional market across all incomes.</p>

    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Does borrower receive any equity when home is sold?</a>
   <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
    <p>Not always. If the home has appreciated  in value in accordance with the resale restriction formula, the borrower would  share any equity accumulated on the property with the shared equity provider.  The borrower agrees to share any equity gains on the property in exchange for  having an opportunity to own a home. If the home did not appreciate in value,  then the borrower may not get any equity during a sale of the property. Most shared  equity programs are designed to ensure that the borrower is not walking away  with less money than what they originally put into the initial home financing transaction.</p>
	<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The term shared  equity refers to the equity that the program administrator is sharing with the  borrower in order for the home to be affordable. With CLTs, they share their  equity position on the land with the borrower by allowing the borrower to use  the land at a reduced lease fee. And, in the income-based resale restricted  programs, the program administrator is sharing in their equity position in the  property by allowing the borrower to purchase the home at a significantly subsidized price.</p>

	<li><strong>Occupancy:</strong> most programs will require that the property be a primary home, owner-occupied  home</li>
	<li><strong>Financing:</strong> the program will review any first or secondary financing that the borrower may  obtain </li>
	<li><strong>Allowable  property improvements: </strong>the program will review any property improvements  that the borrower may want to do on the property.</li>
