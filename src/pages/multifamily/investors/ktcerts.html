<p>Multifamily Aggregation Risk Transfer Certificates (KT Certificates) are backed by multifamily mortgage loans that are awaiting sale into <a href="/multifamily/investors/kcerts.html">K-Series</a> securitizations. KT Certificates are designed to transfer to certain investors a portion of the credit risk associated with eligible multifamily mortgage loans prior to sale into K-Series securitization.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac forms a single trust and sells to the trust eligible mortgage loans on the initial settlement date.&nbsp; During a revolving period, Freddie Mac will from time to time purchase mortgage loans from the trust for sale into K-Series securitizations and replace the purchased mortgage loans with additional eligible mortgage loans.</p>
<p>On the closing date, the trust issues senior guaranteed, mezzanine and first loss certificates. Freddie Mac guarantees timely payment of interest, reimbursement of realized losses and ultimate repayment of principal on the senior guaranteed certificates but does not guarantee the mezzanine or first loss certificates.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>General Structure</h2>
