      <p>This Veterans Day, in communities across the nation, we pay special tribute to veterans and their families.</p>
      <p>Whether it is supporting our servicemen and servicewomen with <a href="http://myhome.freddiemac.com/mortgage-help/military-assistance.html">mortgage relief options</a>, welcoming Honor Flights to the region, or rolling up our sleeves to help renovate a local veterans service center, Freddie Mac employees share a year&ndash;round commitment to support the military community on and off the job.</p>
      <p>We especially honor our employees and their families who have served in the armed forces and make Freddie Mac a better place to work. This includes Michael Dillon (U.S. Army) and John Emans (U.S. Air Force) who kicked off their civilian careers at Freddie Mac and are featured in the most recent issue of Diversity in Action magazine, <a href="http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/diversity-in-action/dia_nov_dec_2016vp/2016110201/#16" class="offsite" rel="external">"Putting Military Skills to Good Use."</a></p>
      <p>To John, Michael and all who served our nation we say, "Thank You."</p>
