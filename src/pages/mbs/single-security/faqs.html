              <p>The Single Security Initiative is a joint initiative of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), under the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the Enterprises&rsquo; regulator and conservator, to develop a common mortgage-backed security (MBS) that will be issued by the Enterprises to finance fixed-rate mortgage loans backed by one- to four-unit single-family properties. The <a class="offsite" href="http://www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/ReportDocuments/2014StrategicPlan05132014Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>2014 Strategic Plan for the Conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</em></a> (<em>2014 Conservatorship Strategic Plan</em>) includes the goal of developing a common MBS. This goal is part of broader efforts to build a Common Securitization Platform (CSP), and it supports FHFA&rsquo;s statutory obligation to ensure that the Enterprises&rsquo; operations and activities foster liquidity in the nation&rsquo;s housing finance markets. Achievement of the goal will also reduce or eliminate Freddie Mac&rsquo;s current program of subsidizing the cost of securitizing single-family mortgage loans to make up for the trading disparity with Fannie Mae&rsquo;s securities, the cost of which is being borne by taxpayers.</p>

              <p>First-level securities (Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities, or UMBS<sup><small>TM</small></sup>) are single-class securities backed by mortgage loans purchased by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. There is no commingling of collateral in UMBS. Similar to today&rsquo;s Fannie Mae Megas and Freddie Mac Giants, second-level securities (Supers) are single-class securities collateralized by other single-class securities. Supers securities will allow for the commingling of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae UMBS as well as other Supers.</p>

                  Is it expected that legacy Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and legacy Freddie Mac participation certificates (PCs) will be fungible with the Single Security?</a>
              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>The features and characteristics of the UMBS will be based generally on Fannie Mae MBS characteristics and, as such, Fannie Mae MBS are will be fungible with the new security. In essence, Fannie Mae MBS will &ldquo;become&rdquo; the new security and Freddie Mac will make changes to its security structure to more closely match Fannie Mae&rsquo;s security, resulting in a common UMBS.</p>
              <p>Freddie Mac will offer investors the option to exchange legacy Freddie Mac PCs for comparable UMBS backed by the same mortgage loans.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>As with current Enterprise securities, for the new securities issued after the implementation of the Single Security Initiative, the guarantor will be the issuing Enterprise.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>The guarantor could be the same, or it could be different. For each, the guarantor is always the issuing Enterprise. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will each issue their own UMBS.&nbsp; At the second level &ndash; Supers &ndash; collateral may be mixed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac UMBS and/or Supers, or a single issuer&rsquo;s securities.&nbsp; In either case, the Supers security could be issued by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, regardless of whether their own collateral is contained in the security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the example on page 1 of Appendix B of the <a class="offsite" href="http://www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/Pages/update-on-the-structure-of-the-single-security-2015.aspx">Update on the Structure of the Single Security</a> for information related to counterparty risk.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Commingling is allowed in second-level but not in first-level securities. In either context, the guarantor is the issuing Enterprise. For example, an investor who owns a first-level security issued by one Enterprise will be able to re-securitize it through the second Enterprise by paying any applicable fee. The timely payment of principal and interest on the resulting second-level security will be guaranteed by the second Enterprise, and that guarantee will be supported by the first Enterprise&rsquo;s guarantee to the trust of the second-level security of timely payment of principal and interest on the first-level security.</p>

              <p><p class="red">UPDATED AS OF MAY 2018</span></p>
              <p>Yes, the Enterprises expect that investors, dealers, vendors, and others will need to update contracts, marketing materials, investment documents, systems, and procedures to reflect the new names of TBA-eligible mortgage-backed securities.&nbsp;The Enterprises are already using the names &ndash; UMBS and Supers &ndash; in their outreach to raise awareness of needed name changes.&nbsp;The goal is to provide the market as much preparation time as possible in advance of the Single Security Initiative implementation date of June 3, 2019.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p><p class="red">UPDATED AS OF MAY 2018</span></p>
              <p>FHFA has established the Single Security Governance Committee (SSGC) composed of senior FHFA executives to assess new or revised Enterprise programs, policies, and practices for their effect on the cash flows of MBS eligible for financing through the TBA market. FHFA will also perform ongoing monitoring of loan acquisitions, security issuances, and prepayments and ensure that the Enterprises continue to provide information on a timely basis to facilitate these ongoing assessments.</p>
              <p>FHFA is seeking general alignment on the observed prepayments associated with Enterprise UMBS at the cohort level. FHFA will monitor the respective prepayment rates of both Enterprises and has established tolerance thresholds for prepayment divergence between the Enterprises. Generally, FHFA will investigate differences between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac prepayment speeds when cohort speeds diverge by more than 2 CPR. When differences exceed 3 CPR, FHFA will require that the cause of the divergence be reported to the SSGC.</p>
              <p>The Enterprises remain separate entities with separately issued and guaranteed securities. Each Enterprise will continue to create its own trust agreements and disclosure documents, and must perform its own functions as issuer, master servicer, guarantor, and trustee in an independent manner. FHFA does not believe that complete alignment of the Enterprises, programs, policies or practices is necessary or appropriate.</p>

            <h3>The Common Securitization Platform (CSP)</h3>
                <p class="enlarge weight-normal">Overview</p>
                <ol class="accordion-faq" data-accordion>
                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is the CSP and how does it relate to the Single Security Initiative?</a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>CSP is a technology and operational platform that will perform many of the core back office functions for the UMBS and Supers, as well as most of the Enterprises&rsquo; current securitization functions (bond issuance, settlement, disclosure, bond administration and tax reporting) for single-family mortgages, on behalf of both Enterprises.<br /><br />The CSP is necessary for the implementation of the Single Security Initiative. It enables the Enterprises to implement one aligned new standard security in one common system rather than each Enterprise building to that standard in its own legacy systems. The CSP also makes administering commingled securities much more efficient because all the data from both Enterprises is on one platform.</p>
                </div>
                </li>
                <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Why have a CSP?</a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>Neither Enterprise&rsquo;s current systems can execute commingled re-securitizations, which are critical to the success of the Single Security Initiative. Under FHFA&rsquo;s direction, the CSP was undertaken as a joint initiative by the Enterprises to develop one common, flexible technological and operational platform to support the back office activities related to single-family securitization. These activities involve storing, processing, and transmitting large volumes of data, so that investing in a single platform and carrying out the accompanying operational capabilities to support these functions will benefit both companies, and ultimately, taxpayers.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>Common Securitization Solutions, LLC (also known as CSS) is a joint venture of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. CSS is charged with building and operating the new common securitization platform.</p>

                <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Can the Single Security Initiative be implemented without the CSP?</a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>No. The CSP is necessary for the implementation of the Single Security Initiative. Today, neither Fannie Mae&rsquo;s nor Freddie Mac&rsquo;s infrastructure can support the commingling of the other Enterprise&rsquo;s securities. Commingling is a critical aspect for the fungibility of the UMBS and Supers securities.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>With the CSP&rsquo;s Release 1, which was implemented in late November 2016, Freddie Mac is now using the platform to perform issuance, settlement, and bond administration activities for certain of its single-class securities. &nbsp;A key purpose of Release 1 is to test the core infrastructure and operations of the CSP to minimize any possible market disruption prior to both Enterprises using the platform for issuance of the UMBS and Supers. Successful Release 1 implementation was a critical milestone.&nbsp; The transition of billions of dollars of securities&rsquo; unpaid principal balance (UPB) to the platform &ndash; with no disruption of operations-- has demonstrated that the platform is performing as expected and that those involved can have confidence as the Enterprises and CSS continue to move forward with development and testing for Release 2. Release 2 will bring Fannie Mae&rsquo;s single-family fixed-rate and ARM securities to the platform, which will enable the Enterprises to begin issuing the new securities.</p>

                <p>No. As was planned, Freddie Mac&rsquo;s transition to the platform has had no effect on Seller/Servicers, investors, dealers, vendors, nor the market as a whole.</p>

                  <p>FHFA, the Enterprises, and CSS continue to actively seek input from market participants regarding external readiness timelines as well as the information participants need to implement changes related to the Single Security Initiative and CSP. Based on the June 3, 2019 planned implementation of the Single Security Initiative, market participants are strongly encouraged to complete their preparations by the end of 2018 in preparation for forward trades that could begin in Q1 2019.</p>

The second will be to issue mirror securities &ndash; beginning in August 2018 &ndash; for all 45-day PCs that are eligible for exchange.

                  <p>Fannie Mae will use the new disclosure format as of the June 3, 2019, the Single Security Initiative implementation date.</p>

                  <p>Freddie Mac plans to offer investors compensation payments based on a schedule of rates that would be informed by fair value methodologies, with one or more rates offered for each product type (15‐year PCs, 30 year PCs, etc.). There will be a minimum of one rate of compensation offered for every term/coupon combination (30-year 3% coupon securities, 15-year 2.5% securities, etc.). Freddie Mac may also offer adjustments to the rate of compensation for pools that have specified characteristics that lead to a substantial change in the value to the float compensation.</p>
                  <p>To establish the approximate fair market value for the payment for the 10 days of delay, Freddie Mac intends to leverage the payment delay compensation values produced by OAS models that are commonly used by market participants.</p>

                  <p>In 2016, Freddie Mac introduced Dealer Direct<sup><small>SM</small></sup>, a portal for conducting Giant transactions and some REMIC functions with Freddie Mac&rsquo;s dealer group. The same portal will be used by that dealer group to conduct exchange transactions on behalf of customers. Investors who want to exchange PCs will need to contact a member of this group to initiate a transaction. The details, when finalized, will be available on FreddieMac.com.</p>
                  <p>Exchange requests will be submitted through the Dealer Direct<sup><small>SM</small></sup> portal. In preparation for exchange requests, prior to the Single Security launch Freddie Mac will create mirror 55-day UMBS and non-TBA 55-day securities for all exchange-eligible 45-day PCs. These mirror securities will be backed by the same loans as the original PC. In exchange for their legacy 45-day PC, investors will receive the new 55-day UMBS and compensation for the payment delay. The funds wire for the compensation will be processed before the funds wire window closes the same day.</p>

Freddie Mac has already conducted substantial due diligence regarding these dealers, including the establishment of custodial bank arrangements and counterparty agreements, and the additional effort required to perform due diligence with all investors who want to conduct an exchange transaction could result in delays in the exchange process.</p>

                  <p>An exchange transaction is required for any 45-day collateral before the 55-day Supers security can be issued. This requires two separate transactions; however, if an investor chooses to they may request both an exchange and a Giant/Supers transaction to settle on the same date.
