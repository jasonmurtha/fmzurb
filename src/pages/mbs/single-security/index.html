            The Single Security is a joint initiative of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), under the direction of FHFA, to develop a common mortgage-backed security that will be issued by the Enterprises to finance fixed-rate mortgage loans backed by one- to four-unit single-family properties. The Enterprises will align key components of Fannie Mae’s mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and Freddie Mac’s Participation Certificates (PCs). The goal is to bring additional liquidity and fungibility to the “To-Be-Announced” (TBA) market and to reduce or eliminate the trading disparities that exist today between the Enterprises’ TBA securities.

          <h3>Key Milestones and Timeline</h3>
          <p>
            The implementation of the Single Security Initiative is dependent on the Common Securitization Platform (CSP). The CSP is a technology and operational platform that is being developed by Common Securitization Solutions, LLC, a joint venture of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. CSP will perform many of the core back office operations for the Single Security, as well as most of the Enterprises’ current securitization functions for single-family mortgages, on behalf of the Enterprises.
